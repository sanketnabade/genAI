# Roadmap to Learn Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Introduction to NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of machine learning and deep learning that focuses on enabling computers to understand and process human language. It is a highly researched area with a wide range of applications, from spam classification to language translation.

### Machine Learning Problem Types

In machine learning, problems are broadly categorized into two types:

- **Supervised Learning:** This involves training a model on data with **input features** and corresponding **output targets**. The goal is for the model to learn the relationship between them so it can make predictions on new data. Common supervised learning problems include:
  - **Classification:** Predicting a discrete label, like whether an email is "spam" or "not spam."
  - **Regression:** Predicting a continuous value, such as a house price.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** This involves finding patterns or structures in data without pre-defined labels.

### Handling Text as Features

In many supervised learning scenarios, the input features can be text. For example, in **spam classification**, the features might include the email subject and body. Since machine learning models can't directly understand human language, the core of NLP is converting this raw text into **numerical vectors** that capture its meaning.

### NLP Learning Roadmap

Learning NLP can be thought of as a pyramid, building from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step roadmap:

#### Step 1: Programming Language

Begin by mastering a programming language. **Python** is the most popular choice for NLP due to its extensive libraries and strong community support.

#### Step 2: Text Pre-processing (Part 1)

This is the initial phase of cleaning and preparing text data. Key techniques include:

- **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into individual words or sentences.
- **Lemmatization:** Reducing a word to its base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" to "run").
- **Stemming:** Trimming a word to its root form (e.g., "jumps," "jumping" to "jump").
- **Stopwords Removal:** Eliminating common words like "the," "is," and "a," which often don't add significant meaning.

#### Step 3: Text Pre-processing (Part 2)

Next, convert the cleaned text into numerical vectors. Traditional methods for this include:

- **Bag of Words (BoW):** Represents text as an unordered collection of words, counting the frequency of each word.
- **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF):** Weighs the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
- **Unigrams and Bigrams:** A unigram is a single word, while a bigram is a sequence of two words, used to capture some context.

#### Step 4: Text Pre-processing (Part 3)

More advanced vectorization techniques use neural networks to create word representations called **word embeddings**.

- **Word2Vec:** A technique that learns word associations from a large corpus of text.
- **Average Word2Vec:** A simple method where the vectors of all words in a document are averaged to create a single document vector.

#### Step 5: Deep Learning Models for NLP

To process sequential data like text, you need to understand specific neural network architectures.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Networks designed to handle sequential data, where the output from the previous step is fed as input to the current step.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks:** An advanced type of RNN that can remember information over long periods, solving the vanishing gradient problem in traditional RNNs.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs):** A simplified version of LSTMs that are computationally more efficient.

#### Step 6: Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words. They capture semantic relationships, meaning words with similar contexts have similar vector representations. They can be pre-trained using models like Word2Vec or learned as part of a larger neural network model.

#### Step 7: Advanced Models - Transformers and BERT

The current state-of-the-art in NLP is dominated by **Transformers**. These models, including **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, are more complex but offer superior performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. They rely on the concept of **attention mechanisms** to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence.

### Libraries and Tools

To implement these techniques, you'll use various libraries:

- **Text Processing:** **NLTK** and **SpaCy** are popular choices for tokenization, stemming, and other pre-processing tasks.
- **Deep Learning:** **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** are the leading frameworks for building and training neural networks.
